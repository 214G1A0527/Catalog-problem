# Polynomial Interpolation with Outlier Detection

This project implements Lagrange interpolation to derive polynomial coefficients from given data points and detect outliers based on residuals. It processes two separate JSON datasets, calculates a polynomial equation, and identifies outlier points.

## Features
- Load JSON data from two different files.
- Extract points and their values, handling various numeric bases.
- Perform Lagrange interpolation to find polynomial coefficients.
- Detect and remove outliers based on calculated residuals.
- Output the polynomial equation and identified outliers.
